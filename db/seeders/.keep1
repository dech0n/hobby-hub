Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it. Make a move, Reindeer Games. I don’t know if you’ve been in a fight before, but there’s not usually this much talking. Does anybody have any orange slices? That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. This drink; I like it! Another! We’re just like Kevin Bacon. Dude, you’re embarrassing me in front of the wizards. It’s like a pirate had a baby with an angel. He’s a friend from work!

He was not a true dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon. You know nothing Jon Snow. Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. When people ask what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey. I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things. It's what I do, I drink, and I know things. I choose violence.

The worst thing about prison was the dementors. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious. Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. Today, smoking is going to save lives. And I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do.

Brennan, that is the voice of an angel. Brennan I can't even make eye contact with you right now. Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus. This is going to sound weird, but for a second, I think you took on the shape of a unicorn. I'm Dale, but you have to call me Dragon. One time I wrestled a giraffe to the ground with my bare hands. You and your mom are hillbillies. This is a house of learned doctors. I'm not great at this Hallmark stuff, but Brennan, when I look at you now, I don't want to kick you in the head quite as much. Did we just become best friends?

You remind me of the babe. I move the stars for no one. It's only forever, not long at all. It's so stimulating being your hat. I ask for so little. Just fear me, love me, do as I say and I will be your slave. You have thirteen hours in which to solve the labyrinth, before your baby brother becomes one of us... forever. She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story, no matter what I say.Through dangers untold. And hardships unnumbered. I have fought my way here to the castle; beyond the goblin city, to take back the child that you have stolen. My will is as strong as yours, and my kingdom as great...you have no power over me.
